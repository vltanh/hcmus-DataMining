% smoothmeth  A collection of the data sets used in the book "Smoothing
%             Methods in Statistics," by Jeffrey S. Simonoff,
%             Springer-Verlag, New York, 1996. Submitted by Jeff
%             Simonoff (jsimonoff@stern.nyu.edu).
% 
% 
% This submission consists of 37 files, plus this README file.
% Each file represents a data set analyzed in the book.
% The names of the files correspond to the names given in
% the book. The data files are written in plain ASCII (character)
% text. Missing values are represented by "M" in all data files.
% 
% Several of the files include an alphabetic (labeling) variable. It is
% likely that these files would have to be input into a package using fixed,
% rather than free, format. The relevant files, along with appropriate
% Fortran format statements, are as follows:
% 
%    adptvisa.dat: (f10.4,4x,f7.4,3x,a20)
% 
%    airaccid.dat: (i3,3x,a34)

% 
%    baskball.dat: (f7.4,4x,f6.4,3x,i3,4x,f5.2,3x,i2,3x,a17)
