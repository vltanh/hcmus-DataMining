% You have obtained all of the data used by all of the authors in the
% twenty-one chapters of Case Studies in Biometry.  
% 
% Each chapter contains either one or two data sets, except for Chapter 19,
% which has seven data sets. Corresponding to each data set are ASCII files
% with extensions ".dat" (the data), ".txt" (the data description file), and 
% ".sas" (a simple SAS program to read the .dat file). 
% 
% For chapters containing only one data set, the file name prefix is 
% "ch" followed by chapter number, and then the above extensions.
% For instance, for Chapter 2 you will find files "ch2.dat",
% "ch2.txt", and "ch2.sas".
% 
% For chapters containing two data sets, the letters "a" and "b" are
% added after the chapter number. For instance, for Chapter 1, you will
% find the files "ch1a.dat", "ch1a.txt", "ch1a.sas", "ch1b.dat",
% "ch1b.txt", "ch1b.sas".
% 
% For chapter 19, there are seven data sets, ch19a.dat
% through ch19g.dat.  Each one has the same format, but
% refers to different subsets of the whole data
% set.  Details are given in the single text file, ch19.txt.
% 
% Please note permissions and usage information included in
% the .txt file for each subset.

% 
% The file ch1a.dat is the case data file. It contains the
% following variables.  There are no missing values.
% 
% ID: Integer, 10 character long identification number for
%         a "cell" or census district in the study area.
% 
% x: Real, range (-60.85, 54.13), x-coordinate of the geographic
% 	centroid of each cell.
% 
% y: Real, range (-78.64, 58.30), y-coordinate of the geographic
% 	centroid of each cell.
% 
% pop:  Integer, range (3, 12221), 1980 U.S. Census population
%                  count for each cell.
% 
% cases: Real, range (0, 9.29), incident cases of leukemia (all
%         types) occurring between 1978 and 1982 in each cell.  Fractional
%         values can occur due to partially missing data (see text).
