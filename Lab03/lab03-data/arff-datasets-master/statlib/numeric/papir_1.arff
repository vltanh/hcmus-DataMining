% Data set from an experiment at the paper plant Norske Skog, Skogn, Norway.
% It were described and analysed in Aldrin (1996), and published there.
%
% It consists of 30 observations (rows) and 22 variables (colums), but all 
% response variables are missing for the 28th observation.
%
% Columns 1 to 13 are response variables that describes various qualities 
% of the paper.
%
% Columns 14 to 22 are 9 predictor variables. The first three predictor 
% variables (x1 in column 14, x2 in column 15 and x3 in column 16) were 
% varied systematically through the experiment, taking the values 
% 1, 0 and -1. The next three predictor variables (columns 17 to 19) 
% are constructed as x1**2, x2**2 and x3**2. 
% The last three predictor variables (columns 20 to 22) are constructed 
% as x1*x2, x1*x3 and x2*x3.
