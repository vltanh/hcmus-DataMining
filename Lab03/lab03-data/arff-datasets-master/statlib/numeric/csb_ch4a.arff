% You have obtained all of the data used by all of the authors in the
% twenty-one chapters of Case Studies in Biometry.  
% 
% Each chapter contains either one or two data sets, except for Chapter 19,
% which has seven data sets. Corresponding to each data set are ASCII files
% with extensions ".dat" (the data), ".txt" (the data description file), and 
% ".sas" (a simple SAS program to read the .dat file). 
% 
% For chapters containing only one data set, the file name prefix is 
% "ch" followed by chapter number, and then the above extensions.
% For instance, for Chapter 2 you will find files "ch2.dat",
% "ch2.txt", and "ch2.sas".
% 
% For chapters containing two data sets, the letters "a" and "b" are
% added after the chapter number. For instance, for Chapter 1, you will
% find the files "ch1a.dat", "ch1a.txt", "ch1a.sas", "ch1b.dat",
% "ch1b.txt", "ch1b.sas".
% 
% For chapter 19, there are seven data sets, ch19a.dat
% through ch19g.dat.  Each one has the same format, but
% refers to different subsets of the whole data
% set.  Details are given in the single text file, ch19.txt.
% 
% Please note permissions and usage information included in
% the .txt file for each subset.

% The file ch4a.dat contains the  burlap data, with the following variables:
% 
% 1. mburlap = mean burlap count value obtained over 12 subplot values.
% 
% 2. megg = mean egg mass density per acre obtained over 21 subplot values.
% 
% 3. seegg = estimated standard error of mean egg mass density obtained
% over 21 subplot values.
