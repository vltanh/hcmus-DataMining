% Short Summary:
% Lists all-time NFL passers through 1994 by the NFL passing efficiency rating.
% Associated passing statistics from which this rating is computed are included.
% 
% 
% More Details:
% The NFL describes how to compute its rating in its 1977 document
% "National Football League Passer Rating System" (410 Park Avenue, New York,
% NY  10022-4444, (212) 758-1500) through the use of tables. No formula is
% explicitly stated for rating. But, examining the tables in the "National
% Football League Passer Rating System" one can infer that NFL passer rating is
% 
% [5(Completion Percentage-30)/6] + [10(Touchdown Percentage)/3] +
% [25(19-2(Interception Percentage))/12] + [25(Yards/Attempts-3)/6]
% 
% where it is understood that the values within each set of square brackets are
% truncated to be no smaller than zero and no larger than 475/12. This implies a
% minimal rating of 0 and a maximal rating of 475/3 or about 158.3. If
% 
%           30%  <     Completion Percentage   < 77.5%
%           0%   <     Touchdown Percentage    < 11.875%
%           0%   <     Interception Percentage <  9.5%
%            3   <         Yards per Attempt   < 12.5,
% 
% which is true of most passers having a reasonable number of passing attempts,
% then the rating formula simplifies to
% 
%      [25 + 10(Completion Percentage) + 40(Touchdown Percentage)
%      - 50(Interception Percentage) + 50(Yards/Attempt)]/12
% 
% (see Johnson (1993, 1994). Note that the weights on interception percentage and
% yards per attempt are greatest in magnitude, closely followed by touchdown
% percentage. The weight on completion percentage is a distant fourth in
% magnitude.
% 
% The dataset lists statistics for 26 players. The first 25 are the top 25
% all-time career best rating leaders recognized by the NFL. The 26th player,
% Otto Graham, has statistics which include his performance in the All-America
% Football Conference (1946-1949) which is not recognized by the NFL. The 
% statistics given are current through the 1994 regular season. Only passers with
% a minimum of 1,500 career passing attempts are included.
% 
% Note: By using unofficial 1995 season statistics which appeared in the
% Thursday, December 28 and the Wednesday, December 27 issues of the newspaper
% _USA Today_ one can update the passers below through the 1995 regular season.
% (There could be, however, a new entry to the top 25 at the end of the 1995
% season because of the 1,500 minimum passing attempt cutoff.)
% 
% While the dataset provided gives all-time best career ratings of players,
% rankings of passers are often cited for a current NFL season in newspapers
% (e.g. _USA Today_).
% 
% Different methods of ranking passers by a single numeric rating is also done 
% by the NCAA (see Johnson (1994)) and the Canadian Football League (just the
% NFL method + 100/6? - this fits the data on p. 242 of Meserole (1995)).
% 
% As an interesting note on the use of the rating formula by NFL teams the
% following appeared in the _Star-Tribune_ (Minneapolis newspaper) December
% 30, 1993 just before the last week of the 1993-1994 regular season:
% 
%  "New York Jets coach Bruce Coslet dismissed suggestions he might not
%  play Boomer Esiason on Sunday night at Houston if the game is meaningless.
%  Terms of the trade last winter that brought the quarterback from Cincinnati
%  called for the Bengals to receive a 1994 second-round draft pick if Esiason's
%  passing rating is 89 or higher. Right now, his rating is 87.1."
% 
% Esiason played the game against Houston, Houston eliminating the Jets from
% post-season play, and finished the season with a 84.5 rating (_USA Today_,
% January 5, 1994, 4C).
% 
% 
% Classroom Use of this Data:
% Using the NFL data from Meserole (1995), for which the above inequalities
% hold, one can uncover (at least approximately) the simplified rating formula
% using multiple regression. Students can be told that NFL rating is "based on
% performance standards established for completion percentage, average gain, 
% touchdown percentage and interception percentage" (Meserole (1995)), but the 
% actual formula for rating is not widely publicized. Once the rating formula is
% uncovered, one can see the relative weights that the NFL assigns to these four
% performance standards (see Barra and Neyer (1995) for an alternative). Also, by
% citing unusual passers who don't satisfy the above inequalities an instructor
% can remind students of the dangers of extrapolation when building regression
% models. Here are a few such unusual passers:
% 
% Name   Attempts Completions Yards Touchdowns Interceptions Rating
% 
% Rypien    3          3       15       0            0        87.5
% Marshall  1          1       81       1            0       158.3
% Muster    1          0        0       0            1         0.0
% 
% The data for Arthur Marshall, a wide-receiver for Denver, and for Brad Muster,
% a full-back for Chicago are from the 1992 season. The data for quarterback Mark
% Rypien is for his performance at one point during the 1995 season (see _USA
% Today_, Thursday September 28, 1995, 9C).
% 
% One might also try tracking down the passing (not receiving!) records of Jerry
% Rice for the 1995 season as he apparently threw for a touchdown in the regular
% season finale.
