%             1988 Graphics Section Poster Session
%           Displaying Analysis of Baseball Salaries
% 
%      The Statistical Graphics Section of the  American  Sta-
% tistical  Association is sponsoring a special poster session
% titled "Why They Make What They Make - An Analysis of  Major
% League  Baseball  Salaries."   The  session  will be held in
% August 1988 at the meetings in New Orleans and  is  intended
% to  allow  members  to  compare techniques for analyzing and
% displaying data.  The session provides a forum for both  old
% and  new  graphical techniques to describe and summarize the
% data.
% 
%      The results of each analysis will be  displayed  during
% the  poster session.  Each participant will be given a space
% to display his/her results and  other  conference  attendees
% will be encouraged to discuss them with you.  There will not
% be any formal discussion or comparison of results.   Rather,
% the  opportunity  is  provided for informal comparison among
% ourselves.
% 
%      Since  this  session  is  treated   as   an   organized
% contributed-paper  session,  you  must submit a contributed-
% paper abstract to the ASA  office.   The  abstract  must  be
% postmarked  not  later than February 15, 1988 AND identified
% as a contribution to the special Statistical Graphics  Expo-
% sition.   The  forms can be found in future issues of AMSTAT
% News.  The abstract can be very  general.   A  sample  which
% will  suffice  is  provided below.  Variations might include
% the software, hardware and techniques you plan to use.   You
% have  until August to work on the analysis.  After the meet-
% ings you will be given an opportunity  to  include  a  short
% paper  describing  your  analysis in the 1988 Proceedings of
% the Statistical Graphics Section.

% 
%      This analysis describes and  summarizes  the  relation-
%      ships  between  1987  salaries of major league baseball
%      players and the player's performance.  We use graphical
%      methods to show relationships between a player's salary
%      to his 1986 and career performance statistics  and  the
%      player's team.

%      Description of the 1988 Graphics Section Data Set
% 
%      The data consist of three files consisting of  data  on
% the regular and leading substitute hitters in 1986, the reg-
% ular pitchers in 1986 and the team statistics.   The  salary
% data  were  taken  from  Sports Illustrated, April 20, 1987.
% The salary of any player not included  in  that  article  is
% listed  as an NA.  The 1986 and career statistics were taken
% from The 1987 Baseball Encyclopedia Update published by Col-
% lier  Books,  Macmillan  Publishing  Company, New York.  The
% team attendance figures were obtained from the Elias  Sports
% Bureau, personal conversation.
% 
%      The goal is to use  graphical  methods  to  attempt  to
% explain differences in the salaries of major league baseball
% players and to answer the question "Are players paid accord-
% ing to their performance?".
