% You have obtained all of the data used by all of the authors in the
% twenty-one chapters of Case Studies in Biometry.  
% 
% Each chapter contains either one or two data sets, except for Chapter 19,
% which has seven data sets. Corresponding to each data set are ASCII files
% with extensions ".dat" (the data), ".txt" (the data description file), and 
% ".sas" (a simple SAS program to read the .dat file). 
% 
% For chapters containing only one data set, the file name prefix is 
% "ch" followed by chapter number, and then the above extensions.
% For instance, for Chapter 2 you will find files "ch2.dat",
% "ch2.txt", and "ch2.sas".
% 
% For chapters containing two data sets, the letters "a" and "b" are
% added after the chapter number. For instance, for Chapter 1, you will
% find the files "ch1a.dat", "ch1a.txt", "ch1a.sas", "ch1b.dat",
% "ch1b.txt", "ch1b.sas".
% 
% For chapter 19, there are seven data sets, ch19a.dat
% through ch19g.dat.  Each one has the same format, but
% refers to different subsets of the whole data
% set.  Details are given in the single text file, ch19.txt.
% 
% Please note permissions and usage information included in
% the .txt file for each subset.

% Estimating Pine Seedling Response to Ozone and Acid Rain
% 
% John O. Rawlings and Susan E. Spruill
% 
% The data set ch5.dat contains the following variables:
% 
% 1.  site: coded 1-6 corresponding to the location code used in Table 1.
% 2.  block: block within site coded 1, 2, ... within sites for the RCB designs;
%     block=1 for all observations for the CRD designs, sites 5 and 6.
% 3.  rep: replication within site coded as missing in sites 1-4;
%     coded as 1, 2, ... for replicates in the CRD design.
% 4.  ozone: target ozone treatment, coded 0.0=charcoal filtered air, 
%     1.0=nonfiltered air, "x.x"=target level of ozone as multiple of 
%     ambient ozone level.
% 5.  rain:  acidic rain treatment, coded as pH of rain solution.
% 6.  fam:  genetic family, coded as 1, 2, ... within sites.
% 7.  ppmhrs:  cumulative ozone exposure (ppm-h) during the two years of
%     the trials.
% 8.  vwpH:  cumulative exposure to acidic rain computed as vwpH 
%     = -log(sum(volume*hydrogen ion concentration)).
% 9.  biomass:  total above ground biomass (g) after two growing seasons.
% 10. diam:  increment of diameter growth (mm) during the two growing seasons.
% 11. DMA:  whole-plot component of the covariate initial diameter (mm)
%     expressed as the deviation of the whole-plot mean from the overall
%     site mean.
% 12. DMB:  sub-plot component of the covariate initial diameter (mm)
%     expressed as the deviation of the subplot mean from the whole-plot mean.
% 13. D2HA: whole-plot component of the covariate initial volume, 
%     approximated as diameter squared times height, and expressed as
%     the deviation of the whole-plot mean from the overall site mean.
% 14. D2HB:  sub-plot component of the covariate initial volume and
%     expressed as the deviation of the subplot mean from the whole-plot mean.
% 15. DMOT:  depth to mottling (cm) of the clay soil; one measurement
%     per whole-plot. 
% 
% Missing data are coded with '.'

% NOTE:  The authors have on file letters of permission from
% each of the principal investigators to use the SCFRC data
% in a chapter in the book entitled CASE STUDIES IN BIOMETRY,
% and for the data used in this case study to
% be made available to the readers.
