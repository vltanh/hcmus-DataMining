% Data on the recurrence times to infection, at the point of insertion of
%   the catheter, for kidney patients using portable dialysis equipment.
%   Catheters may be removed for reasons other than infection, in which case
%   the observation is censored.  Each patient has exactly 2 observations.
% 
% The data set has been used by several authors to illustrate random effects
% ("frailty") models for survival data.  However, any non-zero estimate of the
% random effect is almost entirely due to one outlier, subject 21.   
% 
% Variables: patient, time, status, age, 
% 	   sex (1=male, 2=female),
% 	   disease type (0=Glomerulo Nephritis, 1=Acute Nephritis, 
% 	                 2=Polycystic Kidney Disease, 3=Other)
% 	   author's estimate of the frailty
