% You have obtained all of the data used by all of the authors in the
% twenty-one chapters of Case Studies in Biometry.  
% 
% Each chapter contains either one or two data sets, except for Chapter 19,
% which has seven data sets. Corresponding to each data set are ASCII files
% with extensions ".dat" (the data), ".txt" (the data description file), and 
% ".sas" (a simple SAS program to read the .dat file). 
% 
% For chapters containing only one data set, the file name prefix is 
% "ch" followed by chapter number, and then the above extensions.
% For instance, for Chapter 2 you will find files "ch2.dat",
% "ch2.txt", and "ch2.sas".
% 
% For chapters containing two data sets, the letters "a" and "b" are
% added after the chapter number. For instance, for Chapter 1, you will
% find the files "ch1a.dat", "ch1a.txt", "ch1a.sas", "ch1b.dat",
% "ch1b.txt", "ch1b.sas".
% 
% For chapter 19, there are seven data sets, ch19a.dat
% through ch19g.dat.  Each one has the same format, but
% refers to different subsets of the whole data
% set.  Details are given in the single text file, ch19.txt.
% 
% Please note permissions and usage information included in
% the .txt file for each subset.

% 
% The file ch21a.dat contains the spontaneous activity and rectal
% temperature data (416 observations of 6 variables) There are no missing values.
% 
% Variable List:
% 
% OBS:		Observation identification number.
% 
% MORPHINE:	Dose of morphine sulfate (mg/kg) injected into study mice. The 
% 		range is 0 to 8.0.
% 
% DEL9_THC:	Dose of Delta9-THC (mg/kg) injected into study mice.  The 
% 		range is from 0 to 15.0.
% 
% REP:		Identification of study replication.  The entire 5x7 factorial 
% 		design was replicated.
% 
% SPON_ACT:	Spontaneous Activity as defined by the number of interruptions 
% 		of a photocell beam in a clear plastic cage over a 10 minute 
% 		period of time.
% 
% TEMP_B:		Rectal Temperature at baseline (just prior to treatment).
% 
% TEMP_60:	Rectal Temperature at 60 minutes post treatment injection.
