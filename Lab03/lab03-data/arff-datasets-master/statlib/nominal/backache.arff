% Data file:
% This data from "Problem-Solving" on "backache in pregnancy" 
% is in somewhat different
% format from that listed in the book. Each integer is preceded by a space.
% This makes it easier to read. Each line is split in two separated by an
% ampersand. Each line also has a full stop (or period) at the end of each 
% line which should be removed. If you have any queries, please contact me.
