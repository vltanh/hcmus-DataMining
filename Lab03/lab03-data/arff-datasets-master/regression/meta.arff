% 4. Relevant Information:n
%         This DataSet is about the results of Statlog project.
%         The project performed a comparative study between Statistical, Neural 
%         and Symbolic learning algorithms.
% 
%         Project StatLog (Esprit Project 5170) was concerned with comparative 
%         studies of different machine learning, neural and statistical 
%         classification algorithms. About 20 different algorithms were 
%         evaluated on more than 20 different datasets. The tests carried out 
%         under project produced many interesting results.
