% Data from StatLib (ftp stat.cmu.edu/datasets)
%
% This is the data set called `DETROIT' in the book `Subset selection in
% regression' by Alan J. Miller published in the Chapman & Hall series of
% monographs on Statistics & Applied Probability, no. 40.   The data are
% unusual in that a subset of three predictors can be found which gives a
% very much better fit to the data than the subsets found from the Efroymson
% stepwise algorithm, or from forward selection or backward elimination.
% 
% The original data were given in appendix A of `Regression analysis and its
% application: A data-oriented approach' by Gunst & Mason, Statistics
% textbooks and monographs no. 24, Marcel Dekker.   It has caused problems
% because some copies of the Gunst & Mason book do not contain all of the data,
% and because Miller does not say which variables he used as predictors and
% which is the dependent variable.   (HOM was the dependent variable, and the
% predictors were FTP ... WE)
% 
% The data were collected by J.C. Fisher and used in his paper: "Homicide in
% Detroit: The Role of Firearms", Criminology, vol.14, 387-400 (1976)
% 
% 
% The data are on the homicide rate in Detroit for the years 1961-1973.
% FTP    - Full-time police per 100,000 population
% UEMP   - %  unemployed in the population
% MAN    - number of manufacturing workers in thousands
% LIC    - Number of handgun licences per 100,000 population
% GR     - Number of handgun registrations per 100,000 population
% CLEAR  - %  homicides cleared by arrests
% WM     - Number of white males in the population
% NMAN   - Number of non-manufacturing workers in thousands
% GOV    - Number of government workers in thousands
% HE     - Average hourly earnings
% WE     - Average weekly earnings
% 
% HOM    - Number of homicides per 100,000 of population
% ACC    - Death rate in accidents per 100,000 population
% ASR    - Number of assaults per 100,000 population
