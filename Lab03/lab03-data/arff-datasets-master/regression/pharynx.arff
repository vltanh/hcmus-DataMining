% DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
% 
% The .dat file gives the data for a part of a large clinical trial
% carried out by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group in the United States. 
% The full study included patients with squamous carcinoma of 15 sites in 
% the mouth and throat, with 16 participating institutions, though only data 
% on three sites in the oropharynx reported by the six largest institutions 
% are considered here. Patients entering the study were randomly assigned to 
% one of two treatment groups, radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy 
% together with a chemotherapeutic agent.  One objective of the study was to 
% compare the two treatment policies with respect to patient survival.

% STORY BEHIND THE DATA:
% 
% Approximately 30% of the survival times are censored owing primarily to 
% patients surviving to the time of analysis. Some patients were lost
% to follow-up because the patient moved or transferred to an institution not
% participating in the study, though these cases were relatively rare. From 
% a statistical point of view, an important feature of these data is the 
% considerable lack of homogeneity between individuals being studied. 
% Of course, as part of the study design, certain criteria for patient 
% eligibility had to be met which eliminated extremes in the extent of disease, 
% but still many factors are not controlled.
% 
% This study included measurements of many covariates which would be expected 
% to relate to survival experience. Six such variables are given in the data 
% (sex, T staging, N staging, age, general condition, and grade).   The site 
% of the primary tumor and possible differences between participating 
% institutions require consideration as well.
%      
% The T,N staging classification gives a measure of the extent of the tumor at 
% the primary site and at regional lymph nodes. T=1, refers to a small primary 
% tumor, 2 centimeters or less in largest diameter, whereas T=4 is a massive 
% tumor with extension to adjoining tissue. T=2 and T=3 refer to intermediate
% cases. N=0 refers to there being no clinical evidence of a lymph node 
% metastasis and N=1, N=2, N=3 indicate, in increasing magnitude, the extent of 
% existing lymph node involvement. Patients with classifications T=1,N=0; 
% T=1,N=1;  T=2,N=0; or T=2,N=1, or with distant metastases were excluded 
% from study.
% 
% The variable general condition gives a measure of the functional capacity of 
% the patient at the time of diagnosis (1 refers to no disability whereas
% 4 denotes bed confinement; 2 and 3 measure intermediate levels). The variable
% grade is a measure of the degree of differentiation of the tumor (the degree
% to which the tumor cell resembles the host cell) from 1 (well differentiated) 
% to 3 (poorly differentiated)
% 
% In addition to the primary question whether the combined treatment mode is
% preferable to the conventional radiation therapy, it is of considerable 
% interest to determine the extent to which the several covariates relate to
% subsequent survival.  It is also imperative in answering the primary question 
% to adjust the survivals for possible imbalance that may be present in the 
% study with regard to the other covariates. Such problems are similar to those 
% encountered in the classical theory of linear regression and the analysis of 
% covariance.  Again, the need to accommodate censoring is an important 
% distinguishing point. In many situations it is also important to develop 
% nonparametric and robust procedures since there is frequently little empirical
% or theoretical work to support a particular family of failure time 
% distributions.
