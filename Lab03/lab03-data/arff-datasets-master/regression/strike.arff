% Data from StatLib (ftp stat.cmu.edu/datasets)
%
% The data consist of annual observations on the level of strike volume
% (days lost due to industrial disputes per 1000 wage salary earners),
% and their covariates in 18 OECD countries from 1951-1985. The average
% level and variance of strike volume varies across countries. The data
% distribution also features a long right tail and several large
% outliers. The 7 data fields include the following variables: (1)
% country code; (2) year; (3) strike volume; (4) unemployment; (5)
% inflation; (6) parliamentary representation of social democratic and
% labor parties; and (7) a time-invariant measure of union
% centralization. 
%
% These data were analyzed in the forthcoming paper by Bruce Western,
% "Vague Theory and Model Uncertainty in Macrosociology," which is to
% appear in Sociological Methodology.
