%       -- Steve applied his EACH program to predict survival (i.e., life
%          or death), did not use the wall-motion attribute, and recorded 87 
%          correct and 29 incorrect in an incremental application to this
%          database.  He also showed that, by tuning EACH to this domain,
%          EACH was able to derive (non-incrementally) a set of 28 
%          hyper-rectangles that could perfectly classify 119 instances.

%       -- They predicted the same variable (whether patients will live
%          one year after a heart attack) using a different set of 345
%          instances.  Their statistical test recorded a 61% accuracy
%          in predicting that a patient will die (post-hoc fit).
%    -- 3. Elvin Kinney (in communication with Steven Salzberg) reported
%          that a Cox regression application recorded a 60% accuracy
%          in predicting that a patient will die.
% 
% 4. Relevant Information:
%   -- All the patients suffered heart attacks at some point in the past.
%      Some are still alive and some are not.  The survival and still-alive
%      variables, when taken together, indicate whether a patient survived
%      for at least one year following the heart attack.  
% 
%      The problem addressed by past researchers was to predict from the 
%      other variables whether or not the patient will survive at least
%      one year.  The most difficult part of this problem is correctly
%      predicting that the patient will NOT survive.  (Part of the difficulty
%      seems to be the size of the data set.)
% 
% 5. Number of Instances: 132
% 
% 6. Number of Attributes: 13 (all numeric-valued)
% 
% 7. Attribute Information:
%    1. survival -- the number of months patient survived (has survived,
%                   if patient is still alive).  Because all the patients
%                   had their heart attacks at different times, it is 
%                   possible that some patients have survived less than
%                   one year but they are still alive.  Check the second
%                   variable to confirm this.  Such patients cannot be 
%                   used for the prediction task mentioned above.
%    2. still-alive -- a binary variable.  0=dead at end of survival period,
%                      1 means still alive 
%    3. age-at-heart-attack -- age in years when heart attack occurred
%    4. pericardial-effusion -- binary. Pericardial effusion is fluid
%                               around the heart.  0=no fluid, 1=fluid
%    5. fractional-shortening -- a measure of contracility around the heart
%                                lower numbers are increasingly abnormal
%    6. epss -- E-point septal separation, another measure of contractility.  
%               Larger numbers are increasingly abnormal.
%    7. lvdd -- left ventricular end-diastolic dimension.  This is
%               a measure of the size of the heart at end-diastole.
%               Large hearts tend to be sick hearts.
%    8. wall-motion-score -- a measure of how the segments of the left
%                            ventricle are moving
%    9. wall-motion-index -- equals wall-motion-score divided by number of
%                            segments seen.  Usually 12-13 segments are seen
%                            in an echocardiogram.  Use this variable INSTEAD
%                            of the wall motion score.
%    10. mult -- a derivate var which can be ignored
%    11. name -- the name of the patient (I have replaced them with "name")
%    12. group -- meaningless, ignore it
%    13. alive-at-1 -- Boolean-valued. Derived from the first two attributes.
%                      0 means patient was either dead after 1 year or had
%                      been followed for less than 1 year.  1 means patient 
%                      was alive at 1 year.
