% NAME:  Sexual activity and the lifespan of male fruitflies
% TYPE:  Designed (almost factorial) experiment
% SIZE:  125 observations, 5 variables
% 
% DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
% A cost of increased reproduction in terms of reduced longevity has been
% shown for female fruitflies, but not for males.  The flies used were an
% outbred stock.  Sexual activity was manipulated by supplying individual
% males with one or eight receptive virgin females per day.  The
% longevity of these males was compared with that of two control types.
% The first control consisted of two sets of individual males kept with
% one or eight newly inseminated females.  Newly inseminated females will
% not usually remate for at least two days, and thus served as a control
% for any effect of competition with the male for food or space.  The
% second control was a set of individual males kept with no females.
% There were 25 males in each of the five groups, which were treated
% identically in number of anaesthetizations (using CO2) and provision of
% fresh food medium.

% SPECIAL NOTES:
% `Compliance' of the males in the two experimental groups was documented
% as follows:  On two days per week throughout the life of each
% experimental male, the females that had been supplied as virgins to
% that male were kept and examined for fertile eggs.  The insemination
% rate declined from approximately 7 females/day at age one week to just
% under 2/day at age eight weeks in the males supplied with eight virgin
% females per day, and from just under 1/day at age one week to
% approximately 0.6/day at age eight weeks in the males supplied with one
% virgin female per day.  These `compliance' data were not supplied for
% individual males, but the authors say that "There were no significant
% differences between the individual males within each experimental
% group."
% 
% STORY BEHIND THE DATA:
% James Hanley found this dataset in _Nature_ and was attracted by the
% way the raw data were presented in classical analysis of covariance
% style in Figure 2.  He read the data points from the graphs and brought
% them to the attention of a colleague with whom he was teaching the
% applied statistics course.  Dr. Liddell thought that with only three
% explanatory variables (THORAX, plus PARTNERS and TYPE to describe the
% five groups), it would not be challenging enough as a data-analysis
% project.  He suggested adding another variable.  James Hanley added
% SLEEP, a variable not mentioned in the published article.  Teachers can
% contact us about the construction of this variable.  (We prefer to
% divulge the details at the end of the data-analysis project.)
% 
% Further discussion of the background and pedagogical use of this
% dataset can be found in Hanley (1983) and in Hanley and Shapiro
% (1994).  To obtain the Hanley and Shapiro article, send the one-line

% PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:
% This has been the most successful and the most memorable dataset we
% have used in an "applications of statistics" course, which we have
% taught for ten years.  The most common analysis techniques have been
% analysis of variance, classical analysis of covariance, and multiple
% regression.  Because the variable THORAX is so strong (it explains
% about 1/3 of the variance in LONGEVITY), it is important to consider it
% to increase the precision of between-group contrasts.  When students
% first check and find that the distributions of thorax length, and in
% particular, the mean thorax length, are very similar in the different
% groups, many of them are willing to say (in epidemiological
% terminology) that THORAX is not a confounding variable, and that it can
% be omitted from the analysis.
% 
% There is usually lively discussion about the primary contrast.  The
% five groups and their special structure allow opportunities for
% students to understand and verbalize what we mean by the term
% "statistical interaction."
% 
% There is also much debate as to whether one should take the SLEEP
% variable into account.  Some students say that it is an `intermediate'
% variable.  Some students formally test the mean level of SLEEP across
% groups, find one pair where there is a statistically significant
% difference, and want to treat it as a confounding variable.  A few
% students muse about how it was measured.
% 
% There is heteroscedasticity in the LONGEVITY variable.
% 
% One very observant student (now a professor) argued that THORAX cannot
% be used as a predictor or explanatory variable for the LONGEVITY
% outcome since fruitflies who die young may not be fully grown, i.e., it
% is also an intermediate variable.  One Ph.D. student who had studied
% entomology assured us that fruitflies do not grow longer after birth;
% therefore, the THORAX length is not time-dependent!
% 
% Curiously, the dataset has seldom been analyzed using techniques from
% survival analysis.  The fact that there are no censored observations is
% not really an excuse, and one could easily devise a way to introduce
% censoring of LONGEVITY.
